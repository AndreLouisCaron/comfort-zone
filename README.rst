Description
===========

This library is an I/O toolkit for Windows.  It is based on strategic use of
fibers (userspace threads with cooperative scheduling), which allows it to
combine the efficiency of asynchronous I/O with the simplicity of
synchronous/blocking I/O programs.

It take its name from the following definition of "comfort zone":

   The comfort zone is a behavioural state within which a person operates in an
   anxiety-neutral condition, using a limited set of behaviours to deliver a
   steady level of performance, usually without a sense of risk.

So basically it aims at providing an C++ I/O toolkit for Windows with the
following qualities:

- **simple**: understands that mixing callbacks, mutable state and manual
  memory management is not for the faint of heart (even highly experienced
  programmers have a hard time getting it right);
- **complete**: understands that you need to do more than just asynchronous I/O
  on sockets and that _real_ server programs manipulate files, pipes,
  processes, etc.;
- **uniform**: understands that you don't want to have to understand special
  cases for each type of I/O device you're dealing with;
- **efficient** understands that subpar performance is never acceptable, most
  programs grow into new situations that shouldn't require a complete rewrite
  to change the I/O toolkit.

Basically, the I/O toolkit makes sure you deliver the best performance while
staying in your comfort zone.


Status
======

The library currently serves as a proof of concept, is in active development
and should be considered *highly experimental*.


Features
========

Key features include:

- uniform API for dealing with:
  * TCP sockets;
  * files;
  * anonymous pipes;
  * standard input, output and error streams;
  * mutexes, semaphores, timers, threads, processes and jobs;
  * filesystem changes; and
  * CPU-bound tasks.
- efficient multiplexed waits for awaiting completion of large numbers of
  asynchronous operations;
- coroutine-based parallel processing for effortless lock-free programming.

The promise-based API makes it easy to implement scatter-gather type parallel
programming: start N tasks in parallel and wait until any or all of them to
complete!  This is especially useful for dealing with timeouts on asynchronous
operations: in contast to callback-based APIs, promises really shine here.


Design
======

The `cz::Engine` uses an I/O completion port as a synchronization primitive:
this kernel-level queue for notifications makes a nice multiple-producer,
single-consumer queue to which *all* asynchronous operations report their
completion.

The `cz::Promise` is just a bookeeping tool for tracking the status of an
asynchronous operation.  When the operation completes, a completion
notification is posted to the I/O completion port.  Then, application can have
the `cz::Engine` process notifiations and update the state of the
`cz::Promise`.

The `cz::Promise::Set` is an intrusive container for `cz::Promise` objects.
The following operations on the set are O(1):
- watching a promise;
- ignoring a promise;
- querying how many promises have been settled; and
- removing one settled promise.
To implement these O(1) operations, the set uses a couple of tricks.  In
particular, it relies on promises knowing their own position inside this
container (that's why you can't use a naive `std::vector<cz::Promise>` for
implementing multiplexed waits).


Compiling
=========

#. Launch a `Microsoft Visual Studio`_ command prompt.

   The program and its dependencies are known to compile using Microsoft Visual
   Studio 9 (2008) and Microsoft Visual Studio 10 (2010) and may compile using
   some older versions.

#. Check out the source code and dependencies using Git_.

   ::

      rem: fetch the code.
      git clone git@github.com:AndreLouisCaron/comfort-zone.git
      cd comfort-zone

      rem: fetch its dependencies.
      git submodule init
      git submodule update

#. Generate NMake build scripts using CMake_.

   ::

      rem: generate build scripts.
      mkdir work && cd work
      cmake .. -G "NMake Makefiles"

   You can add the ``-DFIO_TRACE=ON`` option to enable logging of context
   switches, I/O operations and other key elements in execution.

#. Compile the library and, its demo programs and its tests.

   ::

      rem: build all targets.
      nmake

#. Compile the documentation.

   ::

      rem: build the optional documentation target.
      nmake help

#. Run the tests.

   ::

      rem: run all tests.
      nmake /A test
