Description
===========

This library is an I/O toolkit for Windows.  It is based on strategic use of
fibers (userspace threads with cooperative scheduling), which allows it to
combine the efficiency of asynchronous I/O with the simplicity of
synchronous/blocking I/O programs.

It take its name from the following definition of "comfort zone":

   The comfort zone is a behavioural state within which a person operates in an
   anxiety-neutral condition, using a limited set of behaviours to deliver a
   steady level of performance, usually without a sense of risk.

So basically it aims at providing an I/O toolkit for C++ with the following
qualities:

- **simple**: understands that mixing callbacks, mutable state and manual
  memory management is not for the faint of heart (even highly experienced
  programmers have a hard time getting it right);
- **complete**: understands that you need to do more than just asynchronous I/O
  on sockets and that _real_ server programs manipulate files, pipes,
  processes, etc.;
- **uniform**: understands that you don't want to have to understand special
  cases for each type of I/O device you're dealing with;
- **efficient** understands that subpar performance is never acceptable, most
  programs grow into new situations that shouldn't require a complete rewrite
  to change the I/O toolkit.

Basically, the I/O toolkit makes sure you deliver the best performance while
staying in your comfort zone.


Status
======

The library currently serves as a proof of concept, is in active development
and should be considered to tbe *higlhly experimental*.


Features
========

Key features include:

- uniform API for dealing with:

  * asynchronous network I/O;
  * asynchronous file I/O;
  * synchronous pipe & standard input/output/error I/O;
  * jobs, processes, threads,  mutexes, semaphores;

- coroutine-based parallel processing for effortless lock-free programming.


Compiling
=========

#. Launch a `Microsoft Visual Studio`_ command prompt.

   The program and its dependencies are known to compile using Microsoft Visual
   Studio 9 (2008) and Microsoft Visual Studio 10 (2010) and may compile using
   some older versions.

#. Check out the source code and dependencies using Git_.

   ::

      rem: fetch the code.
      git clone git@github.com:AndreLouisCaron/comfort-zone.git
      cd comfort-zone

      rem: fetch its dependencies.
      git submodule init
      git submodule update

#. Generate NMake build scripts using CMake_.

   ::

      rem: generate build scripts.
      mkdir work && cd work
      cmake .. -G "NMake Makefiles"

   You can add the ``-DFIO_TRACE=ON`` option to enable logging of context
   switches, I/O operations and other key elements in execution.

#. Compile the program.

   ::

      rem: build all targets.
      nmake
