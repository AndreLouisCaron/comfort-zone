Description
===========

This library is an I/O framework for Windows.  It is based on strategic use of
fibers (userspace threads with cooperative scheduling), which allows it to
combine the efficiency of asynchronous I/O with the simplicity of
synchronous/blocking I/O programs.


Compiling
=========

#. Launch a `Microsoft Visual Studio`_ command prompt.

   The program and its dependencies are known to compile using Microsoft Visual
   Studio 9 (2008) and Microsoft Visual Studio 10 (2010) and may compile using
   some older versions.

#. Check out the source code and dependencies using Git_.

   ::

      git clone git@github.com:AndreLouisCaron/fio.git
      cd fio
      git submodule init
      git submodule update

#. Generate NMake build scripts using CMake_.

   ::

      mkdir work && cd work
      cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" ..

#. Compile the program.

   ::

      nmake
